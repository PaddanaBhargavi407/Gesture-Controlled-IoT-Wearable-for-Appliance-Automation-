# Gesture-Controlled-IoT-Wearable-for-Appliance-Automation
This project is a gesture-controlled IoT wearable system built using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, ADXL345 accelerometer, and OLED display. It detects hand gestures to control appliances like a fan and bulb, providing visual feedback on the OLED screen and logging status data to ThingSpeak over WiFi. The system includes a buzzer for alert feedback and demonstrates how MEMS sensors can be used for contactless home automation in smart wearable devices.
